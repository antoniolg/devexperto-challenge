# DevExperto Summer Challenge

This is a challenge I originally created at [http://devexperto.com](http://devexperto.com)

The challenge consists of learning 3 languages in 2 months (July and August) by using Koans and Katas.

## How to participate?

1. Choose 3 languages, find some Koans on the Internet and do them. The idea is to learn one every 15 days (and have 15 days of holidays, you earned them!)
- Solve a Kata using each of these languages. I suggest using [Bowling Kata](http://butunclebob.com/ArticleS.UncleBob.TheBowlingGameKata), though you may choose whatever you want.
- Create a Pull Request to this repository, and upload your solutions in a folder with the name of your Github user. Add a readme.md explaining which languages you chose, which Koans you did and some additional info to run your examples.

And that's all! Learning new languages help become a better developer. I hope to see your PRs by the end of August.
