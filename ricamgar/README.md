# devexperto-challenge

I started this challenge with Go language. I decided to do the [BowlingGame Kata](http://butunclebob.com/ArticleS.UncleBob.TheBowlingGameKata)

In order to execute it, follow first the [Go installation instructions](https://golang.org/doc/install).
Once Go is installed, run the command **go test** inside the *src/main* package
